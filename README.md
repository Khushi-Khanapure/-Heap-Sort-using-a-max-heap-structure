# -Heap-Sort-using-a-max-heap-structure
This C++ program implements Heap Sort using a max-heap structure. It defines a HeapSort class with methods for input (getN(), get()), output (put()), sorting (sort()), heap create (create()), and heap adjustment (downAdj()). The main() function initializes the sorting process, displaying both the unsorted and sorted arrays.
